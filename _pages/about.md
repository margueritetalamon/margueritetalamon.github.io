Since January 2025, I am a postdoc researcher at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris) Paris, [Willow team](https://www.di.ens.fr/willow/).
My thesis, [Algorithmic and Computational Foundations of Differentiable Collision Detection](https://inria.hal.science/tel-05004546), was supervised by [Josef Sivic (CTU Prague)](https://www.di.ens.fr/~josef/), [Vladimir Petrik (CTU Prague)](https://petrikvladimir.github.io/) and [Justin Carpentier (INRIA Paris)](https://jcarpent.github.io/).
Before that, I received a Master's degree from [ENPC](https://ecoledesponts.fr/) Paris in [Computer Science and Applied Mathematics](https://www.master-mva.com/).

My research focuses on (differentiable) physics simulation and mathematical optimization in the context of robotics.
