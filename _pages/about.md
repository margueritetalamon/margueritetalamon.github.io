Since November 2024, I am working with [Anna Korba](https://akorba.github.io) as a research assistant at [CREST](https://crest.science) in Paris. I will begin my PhD there in October 2025 under her supervision.

My research focus on optimization problems in the Wasserstein space. I am currently working on variational inference with mixtures of Gaussians.
