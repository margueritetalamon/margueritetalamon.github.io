Since October 2025 I am a PhD student under the supervision of [Anna Korba](https://akorba.github.io) at [CREST](https://crest.science) in Paris, where I also worked as a research assistant during a pre-PhD period starting in November 2024.

My research focus on optimization problems in the Wasserstein space. I am currently working on variational inference with mixtures of Gaussians.
